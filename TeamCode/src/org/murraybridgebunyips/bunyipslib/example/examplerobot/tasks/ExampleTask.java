// Tasks are used to run OpMode code in Autonomous sections. It works by giving each task a specific
// amount of time to run, where it has it's own loop to run code in. This is useful for running
// specific tasks, such as moving the drive system for a certain amount of time, or until a certain
// condition is met. OpMode injection is now handled automatically with the use of a singleton property 'opMode',
// available in both a Task and a BunyipsComponent (and extensions).
// More recently, the Task system has expanded into TeleOp, where these Tasks represent commands when used with the Scheduler.
// See ExampleCommandBasedTeleOp.java for more information.
