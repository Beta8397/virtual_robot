# PersonalityCore

PersonalityCore is a set of common classes used between our mirrored robot builds
for 2023-2024 CENTERSTAGE, FTC 15215 and 22407.

These are not particularly useful for other teams, but are excellent examples of
using and creating BunyipsLib components with mutate-dispatch event handling.
