## TeamCode

This is a reflected copy of the core components of https://github.com/Murray-Bridge-Bunyips/BunyipsFTC.<br><br>
BunyipsLib is under `common/`, default testing virtual_robot OpModes are under `samples/`, and there is
a bot under `imposter/` to test a virtual robot configuration, as other robots won't work with this simulator due to
configuration differences. Some features from BunyipsLib was stripped (vision, etc.) as they are impossible in this context.
