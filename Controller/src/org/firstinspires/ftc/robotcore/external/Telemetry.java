/**
 * Instances of {@link Telemetry} provide a means by which data can be transmitted from the
 * robot controller to the driver station and displayed on the driver station screen.
 *
 * <p>Simple use of {@link Telemetry} consists of a series of {@link #addData(String, String, Object...)
 * addData()} calls, followed by a call to {@link #update()}. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     // LinearOpMode
 *     telemetry.addData("count", currentCount);
 *     telemetry.addData("elapsedTime", "%.3f", elapsedSeconds);
 *     telemetry.update();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the 2015/16 season, the call to {@link #update()} was not required; now, however,
 * in a {@link LinearOpMode}, unless {@link #update()} is called, nothing will appear on the
 * driver station screen. In other, loop-based opmodes, {@link #update()} continues to be called
 * automatically at the end of {@link OpMode#loop()} and {@link OpMode#init_loop()}; no call to
 * {@link #update()} is required in loop-based opmodes.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     // loop-based opmode
 *     telemetry.addData("count", currentCount);
 *     telemetry.addData("elapsedTime", "%.3f", elapsedSeconds);
 * </pre>

 * <p>By default (but see {@link #setAutoClear(boolean) setAutoClear()}), data is cleared from the
 * telemetry after each call to {@link #update()}; thus, you need to issue {@link #addData(String,
 * Object) addData()} for the entire contents of the telemetry screen on each update cycle.
 * This behavior is just as it was in the 2015/16 season.</p>
 *
 * <p>A more complicated use of {@link Telemetry} might have different parts of the program update
 * different items on the display in a decoupled, decentralized manner. Such situations might
 * usefully avail themselves of turning off the auto-clear setting. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     telemetry.setAutoClear(false);
 *     Telemetry.Item countItem = telemetry.addData("count", 0);
 *     Telemetry.Item elapsedItem = telemetry.addData("elapsedTime", 0);
 *
 *     void onePartOfYourCode() {
 *         ...
 *         countItem.setValue(0);
 *         telemetry.update();
 *         ...
 *     }

 *     void anotherPartOfYourCode() {
 *         ...
 *         elapsedItem.setValue("%.3f", elapsedSeconds);
 *         telemetry.update();
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In this way different parts of the code can update only a portion of the telemetry screen
 * without disturbing other parts.</p>
 *
 * <p>Below the list of caption, value, pairs, on the screen a {@link Telemetry} also displays
 * a short, unstructured log of messages. Use {@link Log#add(String, Object...) log().add()}
 * to add to the log. See also {@link #log()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Actual transmission to the driver station is throttled to avoid use of excessive bandwidth.
 * By default, transmission will occur at most every 250ms. This interval can be controlled with
 * {@link #setMsTransmissionInterval(int) setMsTransmissionInterval()}. Any {@link #update()}s which
 * occur more frequently will not be transmitted if superseded by a subsequent {@link #update()}
 * before the transmission interval expires.</p>
 *
 * <p>As mentioned above, by default, after each call to {@link #update()}, the method {@link #clear()}
 * is automatically called. Thus, in simple usage, after each {@link #update()}, you'll want to issue
 * {@link #addData(String, Object) addData()} calls to rebuild the entire driver station telemetry
 * screen that you wish to observe. This simple usage can be modified in two ways.</p>
 *
 * <p>First, the automatic issuance of calls to {@link #clear()} can be altered by means of
 * {@link #setAutoClear(boolean)}. If auto clearing is set to false, previously added telemetry
 * items remain present from {@link #update()} to {@link #update()}, but their value can still be altered
 * using {@link Item#setValue(Object) Item.setValue()}, items can be removed using {@link #removeItem(Item)},
 * and new items can be added using {@link #addData(String, Object) addData()} and {@link Item#addData(String,
 * Object) Item.addData()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Second, telemetry items created in a functional form using {@link #addData(String, Func)} or
 * {@link Item#addData(String, Func)} are <em>not</em> automatically removed when {@link #clear()}
 * is called, either implicitly or explicitly (though they are removed when {@link #clearAll()} is
 * called). The intent of such items is allow a one-time specification of telemetry items by
 * providing a function that can <em>produce</em> a value to be displayed rather than providing the
 * actual value itself. Such functions are evaluated only when it is known that telemetry is going to
 * be transmitted to the driver station (and so a value is required). This approach can be particularly
 * useful if the acquisition of the data to be displayed is relatively expensive or time consuming, as
 * that cost is only expended when actually useful.
 *
 * In addition to one-item-per-line display on the driver station, multiple items per line can
 * be displayed by starting with a call to {@link #addLine()} and then following up with one or more
 * {@link #addData(String, Object)} calls. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     telemetry.addLine()
 *          .addData("count", currentCount)
 *          .addData("elapsedTime", "%.3f", seconds);
 *     telemetry.addLine()
 *          .addData("voltage", "%.1f", getCurrentVoltage())
 *          .addData("orientation", "%s", getOrientation());
 *     telemetry.update();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Items on the same line are separated by the {@link #getItemSeparator() item separator}. Caption
 * and value within an item are separated by the {@link #getCaptionValueSeparator() caption value separator}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: in the 2015/16 season, it was possible for {@link Telemetry} instances to be automatically
 * sorted in alphabetical order by caption. This functionality is no longer supported.</p>
