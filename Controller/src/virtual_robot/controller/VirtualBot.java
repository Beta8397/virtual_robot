/**
 *   For internal use only. Abstract base class for all of the specific robot configurations.
 *
 *   The VirtualBot class does not require use of the physics engine. Classes that extend
 *   VirtualBot can utilize the physics engine, or not.
 *
 *   A robot config class that extends VirtualBot must:
 *
 *   1) Provide a no-argument constructor whose first statement is super();
 *   2) Be the controller class for an .fxml file that defines the graphical respresentation of the bot;
 *   3) Provide a createHardwareMap() method;
 *   4) Provide a public synchronized updateStateAndSensors(double millis) method;
 *   5) Provide a public powerDownAndReset() method.
 *
 *   Optionally (and in most cases), it will also be necessary to:
 *
 *   1) Provide a public initialize() method for initialization of accessories whose appearance will change
 *      as the robot operates, and to set up for use of physics engine, if applicable.
 *   2) Override the public synchronized updateDisplay() method to update the appearance of accessories.
 *   3) Override the removeFromWorld() method to remove not only the chassisBody, but any additional
 *      Bodys that have been created to represent robot components.
 *
 *   The ArmBot class has detailed comments regarding the workings of these methods.
